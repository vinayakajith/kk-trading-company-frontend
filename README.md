> **Kerala Rice & Spices, Direct from the Land We Farm.**
> A modern, highly-responsive frontend web application designed for KK Trading Company, a legacy business specializing in premium rice and spice trade in Kerala, India since 1963.

## 📖 Overview

This project is the official frontend landing page for KK Trading Company. It serves to establish a strong digital presence, communicate the brand's rich 150-year agricultural heritage, and showcase its primary product offerings (premium rice varieties and spices). The design is focused on emotional grounding, high visual contrast, and a direct, authoritative tone suitable for B2B wholesale trade.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern & Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Heritage Narrative Arc**: Engaging storytelling sections that transition from farming origins to modern-day trading.
- **Dynamic CSS Architecture**: Built using a robust CSS variable system (custom properties) for easy theming and maintainability.
- **Micro-Animations**: Subtle `reveal-up` animations tied to scroll events for a premium, dynamic feel.
- **Partner Focused**: Dedicated section tailored towards target B2B buyers (Retail Chains, Wholesalers, Distributors, Bulk Buyers).
- **Direct Mail Integration**: Simplified inquiry flow using direct `mailto:` integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic, accessible markup.
- **Vanilla CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox, CSS Grid, clamp() functions, and CSS variables. No external CSS frameworks were used, ensuring optimal performance and complete customizability.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight script for managing the mobile navigation toggle, scroll-triggered animations (Intersection Observer), and dynamic footer year.
- **Google Fonts**: Utilizing 'Inter' for highly readable body copy and 'Playfair Display' for elegant, earthy headings.
